## Overview

The rapid growth of short-video platforms (TikTok, YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels) has
generated massive unlabeled video collections that are expensive to organize manually.
**Video clustering** offers a scalable, unsupervised alternative, but its quality is limited
by the richness of the video representations used.

Compact Vision-Language Models (VLMs) produce short, generic captions that capture only
immediately visible elements, creating a *semantic gap* between low-level visual signals and
high-level meaning. This work addresses that gap by introducing an **LLM-based semantic
enrichment stage** between caption generation and embedding projection.

> **Core Question:** *Can LLM-based semantic enrichment of compact visual descriptions
> improve unsupervised short-video clustering quality?*

**Answer:** Yes — improvements of up to **13.18% in NMI** over the baseline are observed,
statistically validated via paired Wilcoxon tests (p < 10⁻³) and Cohen's d effect size analysis.

## Method

### Problem Definition

Let $\mathcal{V} = \{v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n\}$ be a collection of unlabeled short videos. The
goal is to learn a clustering assignment $g : \mathcal{V} \rightarrow \{1, 2, \ldots, K\}$
**without** class labels during grouping. Clustering quality depends on the representation
function $f : \mathcal{V} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^d$.

### Pipeline

The full representation is defined as:

$f_{m,e}(v_i) = \psi_e\!\left(T_m\!\left(\varphi(v_i),\, q\right)\right)$

where $\varphi$ is the compact VLM captioner (SmolVLM2), $T_m$ is the LLM enrichment function
for model $m$, and $\psi_e$ is the text embedding model $e$.

The **baseline** skips enrichment: $f_{0,e}(v_i) = \psi_e(\varphi(v_i))$.

Before clustering, vectors are standardized: $z = (x - \mu)/\sigma$.

Clustering objective (K-Means):

$\min_{\{\eta_k\}_{k=1}^K} \sum_{i=1}^n \min_{k \in \{1,\ldots,K\}} \left\| z_i^{(m,e)} - \eta_k \right\|_2^2$

### Enrichment Prompt

The following zero-shot prompt is applied uniformly to all LLMs:
````bash
You are a video classifier. Analyze the visual description and:
  1.Choose EXACTLY ONE category from this list: {MSRVTT_CATS}
  2.Propose a NEW free-form category, not in the list.
  3.Provide a brief justification in English.
  4.Provide an Enriched Description in English.
Return ONLY valid JSON format exactly like this:
{
"predicted_category": "...",
"suggested_category": "...",
"justification": "...",
"enriched_description": "..."
}
````
Only the `enriched_description` field is used for downstream embedding and clustering.

### NMI Sensitivity to Number of Clusters (K = 2 to 30)

The figure below shows NMI scores for all 8 configurations (3 LLMs + baseline × 2 embedding
models) as the number of clusters K varies from 2 to 30. The red dashed vertical line marks
K = 20, which corresponds to the MSR-VTT ground-truth taxonomy. Most configurations — especially
with Qwen embeddings — reach a natural peak near K = 20, confirming that the enriched
representations organically capture the dataset's thematic structure. Claude-enriched curves
consistently sit above the baseline across the full K range, evidencing the robustness of the
semantic enrichment benefit beyond the fixed evaluation point.

  Triangles = OpenAI (3072-dim). The red dashed line marks K = 20 (MSR-VTT taxonomy).
  Claude-enriched representations consistently achieve higher NMI across both embedding
  families, peaking naturally near the ground-truth cluster count.</em>
